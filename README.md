## Summary
This repository contains code used for a Machine Learning for Science project : ML-powered Tool for assisted design of Buildings .
It focuses on automating the labor-intensive and resource-demanding process of building design.The tool aims to leverage ML to predict structural specifications and safety evaluations from basic architectural and location-based data of
200 buildings.

## Requirements
- Python 3
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `sklearn`
  - `TensorFlow`and `keras`
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
  - `scikeras`
  - `keras_tuner`
  - `itertools`
  
## Usage


To Create Our ML models , run the following files 

(The preprocessing Steps are stored in 'Files/After_Feature_Engineering' so you can directly run the notebooks)

```
python3 Data_Pre_Processing.py                  :(The output of Data_pre_Processing is already stored in Files/Before_Feature_Engineering)
python3 Split_the_data.py                       :(The output of Split_the_data is already stored in both Files/After_Feature_Engineering and Files/Before_Feature_Engineering)
python3 Feature_Engineering.py                  :(The output of Data_pre_Processing is already stored in Files/After_Feature_Engineering)
Run_Classical_ML_methods.ipynb
Run_Neural_Networks.ipynb
```
